part-time

  The company is looking for the all Taiwan Depot for the advertisement purpose.

  Traditionally, they ask part-time employee to manually search relevant information on Google maps, then copy the address, name,
and phone to the excel. During the work, the data collection of depot takes about 50% time.

  Due to the boring stuff, I decide to create the side project of data collection on google maps.

IDE: VSCODE
ENV: virtualenv
API: Googlemaps
